    "In Python logging, log levels provide a way to categorize log messages based on their severity or importance. Each log level represents a different level of detail or criticality, allowing developers to filter and manage log messages based on their desired granularity. The available log levels in Python logging, in increasing order of severity, are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "DEBUG : \n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest level of severity. Used for detailed information, usually for debugging purposes. These messages are typically only needed during development and are not suitable for production environments. Example usage: Printing variable values for debugging or tracing code execution paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO : \n",
    "\n",
    "Used for informational messages that highlight the progress of the application or important milestones. These messages provide general information about the application's state or actions that can be useful during development and production. Example usage: Logging the start and completion of important processes or significant application events.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING : \n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates potential issues or conditions that may cause problems in the future but do not necessarily indicate an error. These messages help in identifying and addressing situations that might lead to unexpected behavior. Example usage: Warning about the use of deprecated functions or reporting recoverable errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR : \n",
    "\n",
    "Indicates an error has occurred but does not necessarily halt the execution of the program. These messages typically highlight issues that need attention but allow the program to continue running. Example usage: Logging exceptions, validation errors, or other unexpected but recoverable conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL : \n",
    "\n",
    "The highest level of severity. Indicates a critical error or a condition that may cause the program to terminate. These messages often indicate a severe failure or an unrecoverable state. Example usage: Logging fatal errors, system failures, or conditions that require immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "By assigning appropriate log levels to log messages, developers can control the verbosity of the logs based on the desired level of detail or the importance of the logged events. For example, during development and debugging, it is common to set the log level to DEBUG or INFO to gather more detailed information. In production environments, it is usually recommended to set the log level to a higher level such as WARNING or ERROR to focus on critical issues and avoid cluttering the logs with unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that log levels can be configured dynamically, allowing for flexibility in different environments or scenarios. This allows developers to fine-tune the log output based on specific requirements, making logging an effective tool for monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining software applications."

On the other hand, the logging module allows you to direct log messages to different destinations, such as log files, external services, or even send them via email. This flexibility makes logging more suitable for real-world applications that require capturing and managing logs in a centralized manner.\n",

This allows for fine-grained control over which log messages are displayed or saved. In contrast, print statements do not have built-in levels or filtering mechanisms. Logging allows you to control the verbosity and detail level of log messages, making it easier to focus on relevant information during different stages of application development and production.\n",

    "Timestamps and additional metadata : \n",
    "\n",
    "The logging module allows you to include timestamps, log levels, module names, and other metadata in log messages.

    "The logging module offers extensive configuration options. You can customize log message formats, specify output destinations, control log levels, and even configure logging through external configuration files. This configurability allows for easier maintenance and adaptability of the logging behavior. In contrast, print statements are less configurable and require manual changes to the code to modify their behavior.\n",

    "Flexibility : \n",

    "Logging provides greater flexibility in capturing and managing logs across different components of an application. It allows you to redirect log messages to various destinations, enabling centralized log collection and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity and filtering : \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to set log levels and filter log messages based on severity enables better control over what information is logged, making it easier to debug and diagnose issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability : \n",
    "\n",
    "By using logging, you can separate the concern of generating log output from the core logic of your application. This separation allows for easier modification of logging behavior without changing the application's logic extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceability : \n",
    "\n",
    "Including timestamps, log levels, and other metadata in log messages assists in identifying the source and context of issues, making troubleshooting and debugging more efficient.\n",
